A modern data protection service built with Rust, providing continuous, block-level data redundancy and integrity checking for your important directories.

`rs_guard` watches your files, encodes them using Reed-Solomon erasure coding, and regularly verifies their integrity, automatically repairing them from redundant data if corruption is detected. All this is managed through a sleek, real-time web interface.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Block-Level Redundancy**: Splits files into blocks and generates parity shards using Reed-Solomon encoding (configurable `N+M` redundancy).
-   **Continuous Integrity Checking**: Runs background tasks to periodically validate the integrity of both original files and their parity shards.
-   **Automatic Repair**: If a data block or shard is lost or corrupted, `rs_guard` can automatically reconstruct it from the remaining blocks.
-   **Live File Watching**: Uses `notify` to automatically protect new files and update redundancy for modified files.
-   **Web Interface**: A modern, real-time dashboard built with Rust (Yew + Wasm) to monitor status, view logs, and trigger manual operations.
-   **Single-File Deployment**: For production, the entire frontend is embedded into the backend binary, making deployment as simple as copying a single file.
-   **Cross-Platform**: Designed to run as a long-running service on both Windows and Linux.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1.  **Install Rust**: If you don't have it, install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
2.  **Add Wasm Target**: The frontend compiles to WebAssembly. Add the target via:
    ```bash
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```
3.  **Install Trunk**: Trunk is our build tool for the Wasm frontend.
    ```bash
    cargo install trunk
    ```

### Running in Development

For the best development experience with hot-reloading, run the backend and frontend in separate terminals.

1.  **Run the Backend**:
    ```bash
    # This will watch for file changes and serve the API on http://127.0.0.1:3000
    cargo run -p backend
    ```
    *Note: The first time you run this, it will fail if the `./test-data/source` directory doesn't exist. This is expected. The directory will be created for subsequent runs.*

2.  **Run the Frontend**:
    ```bash
    # This serves the Yew app on http://127.0.0.1:8080 and proxies API requests
    cd frontend
    trunk serve
    ```
    Trunk will automatically open a browser tab. Any changes you make to the frontend code will be recompiled and reloaded in the browser automatically.

## üì¶ Building for Production

To create a single, self-contained executable for deployment:

1.  **Build Frontend Assets**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    trunk build --release
    ```
    This generates optimized static files in the `frontend/dist` directory.

2.  **Build Backend with Embedded Frontend**:
    ```bash
    # This builds a release-optimized binary with all frontend assets included
    cargo build -p backend --release
    ```
    The final executable will be located at `target/release/backend` (or `backend.exe` on Windows). You can copy this single file to your server and run it.
